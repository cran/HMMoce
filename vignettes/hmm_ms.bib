abstract = {Movements of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus, ABFT) from specific western Atlantic forage grounds are not well described, and the extent of their spawning areas is mainly surmised. In 2005 and 2006, we deployed 41 pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) on adult Atlantic bluefin tuna off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, and on Georges Bank. During the assumed spawning period, 56{\%} of the tagged ABFT occupied a known spawning area, while 44{\%} were located in distant oceanic regions. Assuming obligate annual spawning, these results are inconsistent with the notion of spawning site fidelity to the Gulf of Mexico. The ocean-wide migrations of adult ABFT tagged on a common forage ground suggest evidence of a metapopulation requiring more spatially explicit management than the current simple two-stock structure.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper describes a blended sea-surface temperature (SST) dataset that is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Data Record (CDR) Program product suite. Using optimum interpolation (OI), in situ and satellite observations are combined on a daily and 0.25° spatial grid to form an SST analysis, i.e., a spatially complete field. A large-scale bias adjustment of the input infrared SSTs is made using buoy and ship observations as a reference. This is particularly important for the time periods when volcanic aerosols from the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo eruptions are widespread globally. The main source of SSTs is the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), available from late 1981 to the present, which is also the temporal span of this CDR. The input and processing choices made to ensure a consistent dataset that meets the CDR requirements is summarized. A brief history and an explanation of the forward production schedule for the preliminary and science-quality final product is also provided.

abstract = {Behaviour and distribution of striped marlin within the southwest Pacific Ocean were investigated using electronic tagging data collected from 2005-2008. A continuous-time correlated random-walk Kalman filter was used to integrate double-tagging data exhibiting variable error structures into movement trajectories composed of regular time-steps. This state-space trajectory integration approach improved longitude and latitude error distributions by 38.5 km and 22.2 km respectively. Using these trajectories as inputs, a behavioural classification model was developed to infer when, and where, 'transiting' and 'area-restricted' (ARB) pseudo-behavioural states occurred. ARB tended to occur at shallower depths (108 +/- 49 m) than did transiting behaviours (127 +/- 57 m). A 16 day post-release period of diminished ARB activity suggests that patterns of behaviour were affected by the capture and/or tagging events, implying that tagged animals may exhibit atypical behaviour upon release. The striped marlin in this study dove deeper and spent greater time at {\textgreater}/= 200 m depth than those in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. As marlin reached tropical latitudes (20-21 degrees S) they consistently reversed directions, increased swimming speed and shifted to transiting behaviour. Reversals in the tropics also coincided with increases in swimming depth, including increased time {\textgreater}/= 250 m. Our research provides enhanced understanding of the behavioural ecology of striped marlin. This has implications for the effectiveness of spatially explicit population models and we demonstrate the need to consider geographic variation when standardizing CPUE by depth, and provide data to inform natural and recreational fishing mortality parameters.},

Transmitted and archived data were obtained from seven tagged mantas over deployment periods of 102–188 days, including three recovered tags containing 2.6 million depth, temperature, and light level data points collected every 10 or 15 seconds. Mantas frequented the upper 10 m during daylight hours and tended to occupy deeper water throughout the night. Six of the seven individuals performed a cumulative 76 deep dives ({\textgreater}150 m) with one individual reaching 432 m, extending the known depth range of this coastal, reef-oriented species and confirming its role as an ecological link between epipelagic and mesopelagic habitats. Mean vertical velocities calculated from high-resolution dive data (62 dives {\textgreater}150 m) from three individuals suggested that mantas may use gliding behavior during travel and that this behavior may prove more efficient than continuous horizontal swimming. The behaviors in this study indicate manta rays provide a previously unknown link between the epi- and mesopelagic layers of an extremely oligotrophic marine environment and provide evidence of a third marine species that utilizes gliding to maximize movement efficiency.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are now widely used to document the geographic and vertical movements of large pelagic fishes. These instruments record measurements of ambient light, depth and temperature at regular intervals and the light data are used to compute daily estimates of latitude and longitude. Several methods have been developed to improve those estimates, including the application of Kalman filter models and matching sea surface temperatures (SST) from tags with remotely sensed SSTs. Despite their widespread use, few studies have evaluated the accuracy of raw estimates of location from PSATs or quantified the improvements that may result from refinement techniques. To assess the accuracy of raw and refined estimates of locations from PSATs, we attached two PSATs and one Argos satellite-linked transmitter (SAT tag) to one whale shark (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. The root mean square error (RMSE) in raw estimates of location provided by the PSATs was 5.16° latitude and 2.00° longitude. Estimates were more accurate after processing the data with a Kalman filter (RMSE = 2.97° latitude and 0.78° longitude) and most accurate after processing with a Kalman filter model that integrates SST measurements (RMSE = 1.84° latitude and 0.78° longitude). We also assessed the precision of the PSAT-derived locations, and depth and temperature measurements by comparing the data from the two PSATs. Our findings support the use of archival tag data to reconstruct the large-scale movements of marine animals and demonstrate the significant improvements that may result from two refinement techniques.},

abstract = {We propose a continuous-time version of the correlated random walk model for animal telemetry data. The continuous-time formulation allows data that have been nonuniformly collected over time to be modeled without subsampling, interpolation, or aggregation to obtain a set of locations uniformly spaced in time. The model is derived from a continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck velocity process that is integrated to form a location process. The continuous-time model was placed into a state-space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land. Also, a northern fur seal pup data set was analyzed with a random drift component to account for directed travel and ocean currents.},

Whereas demersal species have been tracked using tide-driven geolocation models, pelagic species which undertake extensive migrations have been mainly tracked using light-based models. Here, we present a new HMM-based model that infers pelagic fish positions from the sole use of high-resolution temperature and depth histories. A key contribution of our framework lies in model parameter inference (diffusion coefficient and noise parameters with respect to the reference geophysical fields-satellite SST and temperatures derived from the MARS3D hydrodynamic model), which improves model robustness. As a case study, we consider long time series of data storage tags (DSTs) deployed on European sea bass for which individual migration tracks are reconstructed for the first time. We performed a sensitivity analysis on synthetic and real data in order to assess the robustness of the reconstructed tracks with respect to model parameters, chosen reference geophysical fields and the knowledge of fish recapture position. Model assumptions and future directions are discussed. Finally, our model opens new avenues for the reconstruction and analysis of migratory patterns of many other pelagic species in relatively contrasted geophysical environments.},

abstract = {Fishery closed areas provide a resource management tool to protect predictable spawning aggregations of migratory fish species. Movement by individual fish however challenges the effectiveness of fishery closed areas. Recent developments in electronic tags and movement modelling offer new information to quantify fine-scale usages of fishery closed areas by free-ranging individuals. Conventional tagging data, on the other hand, inform on population broad-scale distribution patterns with respect to closed areas. Using the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population from the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence as a case study, we demonstrate how electronic tagging experiments can be supplemented with conventional tagging experiments to evaluate and redesign fishery closed areas. A geolocation model was used to estimate time of arrival, time of departure, and proportion of time that individual cod equipped with data-storage tags spent within a fishery closed area. Two optimization algorithms were developed to seek out the spatial and temporal designs that maximized the proportion of time that the fish equipped with data-storage tags spent inside the closed area, relative to its size and duration. Bootstrap analyses quantified the effects of inter-individual variability in closed area usages. Conventional tagging data were used to estimate the proportion of the spawning population density function encompassed by the closed area. Results from the electronic and conventional tagging experiments suggested that the fishery closed area in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence should be displaced south along the 200-m isobath and that the enforcement period be reduced. Electronic tagging data also suggested that alternative migratory behaviours within a population lead to disproportional levels of protection between migratory and non-migratory groups. A re-examination of past conventional tagging experiments in combination with recent electronic tagging experiments provides new information to evaluate the spatiotemporal design of fishery closed areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Determining light-based geolocations of electronically tagged marine animals by using irradiance measurements in an integrated random walk movement model is presented for improving the precision of the reconstructed geographical tracks. The model avoids making any irradiance threshold assumptions, or constraining the movement of the tag between dawn and dusk, which has limited the efficacy of previous models. Unlike previous models which relied on using previously calculated raw geolocations from outside sources, the new model uses irradiance data to produce the most probable track. The model generates two estimates of geographic positions per day (at dawn and dusk). Prior to this study, the model has been successfully evaluated for tags mounted on moorings, drifters, and in simulated cases. This paper documents the application of the model to wild caught swimming and diving mako sharks and blue marlin. The reconstructed tracks via the new model are compared to tracks adjusted using sea-surface temperature and to very accurate satellite-based tracks. The model performs well for the tested tags, which is surprising as these are pop-off satellite archival tags (PSATs), from which only a small fraction of the light record around approximately dusk and dawn is stored. The integrated model was vastly superior to classical purely light-based methods in all cases.},

Our understanding of these movements has been enhanced by new technologies that now allow us to follow their movements over great distances and long time periods in great detail. This technology provides not only detailed information on the movements of a wide variety of marine species, but also detailed characteristics of the habitats they use and clues to their navigation abilities. Advances in electronic tracking technologies have been coupled with rapid development of statistical and analytical techniques. With these developments, conservation of highly migratory species has been aided by providing new information on where uncommon or endangered species go, what behaviors they perform and why, which habitats are critical, and where they range, as well as, in many cases, better estimates of their population size and the interconnectedness of subpopulations. Together these tools are providing critical insights into the ecology of highly pelagic marine vertebrates that are key for their conservation and management.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The blue shark {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Prionace glauca{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is the most abundant large pelagic shark in the Atlantic Ocean. Although recaptures of tagged sharks have shown that the species is highly migratory, migration pathways towards the overwintering grounds remain poorly understood. We used archival satellite pop-up tags to track 23 blue sharks over a mean period of 88 days as they departed the coastal waters of North America in the autumn. Within 1–2 days of entering the Gulf Stream (median date of 21 Oct), all sharks initiated a striking diel vertical migration, taking them from a mean nighttime depth of 74 m to a mean depth of 412 m during the day as they appeared to pursue vertically migrating squid and fish prey. Although functionally blind at depth, calculations suggest that there would be a ∼2.5-fold thermoregulatory advantage to swimming and feeding in the markedly cooler deep waters, even if there was any reduced foraging success associated with the extreme depth. Noting that the Gulf Stream current speeds are reduced at depth, we used a detailed circulation model of the North Atlantic to examine the influence of the diving behaviour on the advection experienced by the sharks. However, there was no indication that the shark diving resulted in a significant modification of their net migratory pathway. The relative abundance of deep-diving sharks, swordfish, and sperm whales in the Gulf Stream and adjacent waters suggests that it may serve as a key winter feeding ground for large pelagic predators in the North Atlantic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are capable of storing high-resolution behavioral and environmental information for extended periods of time (approximately 1 year), rendering them especially valuable for studying highly mobile species. In this review, we synthesize published PSAT data to understand the biophysical drivers that influence movements of billfishes (families Xiphiidae and Istiophoridae). To date, over 1,080 PSATs have been deployed on billfishes, with individuals demonstrating both trans-equatorial and trans-basin movements. Using this dataset, we identify four main physical variables that drive billfish behavior: temperature, light, oxygen, and complex water mixing (e.g. fronts and eddies). Of the seven species that have been studied with PSAT technology, all exhibited a strong thermal preference for water {\textgreater}22°C, though vertically migrating swordfish additionally occupied waters {\textless}10°C while at depth. Ambient light levels influence vertical movements, especially those associated with foraging, as billfish possess large eyes and thermoregulatory abilities that facilitate feeding behaviors below warm surface layers. Mounting evidence suggests that some billfishes actively avoid regions with low dissolved oxygen ({\textless}3.5 mL L¿1). Human-induced climate change is expected to increase the horizontal and vertical extent of hypoxic water and may further compress habitat and concentrate fishing pressure on pelagic fishes. Finally, complex submeso- and mesoscale processes provide critical habitat for spawning, larval feeding, and retention, but our understanding of these and other behavioral aspects of billfish biology remains limited. Future research efforts should leverage technical advancements while integrating existing and future tag data with chemical and physical oceanographic datasets to gain a better understanding of the relevant biophysical interactions for billfishes, thereby enhancing management capabilities for this ecologically and economically important group of fishes.},

abstract = {Between 2005 and 2009, we deployed 58 miniature pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) and 132 implanted archival tags on juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna (age 2-5) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Data returned from these efforts (n = 26 PSATs, 1 archival tag) revealed their dispersal routes, horizontal and vertical movements and habitat utilization. All of the tagged bluefin tuna remained in the northwest Atlantic for the duration observed, and in summer months exhibited core-use of coastal seas extending from Maryland to Cape Cod, MA, (USA) out to the shelf break. Their winter distributions were more spatially disaggregated, ranging south to the South Atlantic Bight, northern Bahamas and Gulf Stream. Vertical habitat patterns showed that juvenile bluefin tuna mainly occupied shallow depths (mean = 5-12 m, sd = 15-23.7 m) and relatively warm water masses in summer (mean = 17.9-20.9 degrees C, sd = 4.2-2.6 degrees C) and had deeper and more variable depth patterns in winter (mean = 41-58 m, sd = 48.9-62.2 m). Our tagging results reveal annual dispersal patterns, behavior and oceanographic associations of juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna that were only surmised in earlier studies. Fishery independent profiling from electronic tagging also provide spatially and temporally explicit information for evaluating dispersals rates, population structure and fisheries catch patterns.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) is a well-known regulator of many developmental processes. However, its role in adult nervous system is yet unclear. Studies have shown that TGFalpha can regulate stress and memory behavior in adult mice. When TGFalpha is reduced in Waved-1 (Wa-1) mutant mice, the stress response and memory are impaired predominantly in males and only after puberty. To determine the neurochemical changes resulting from the reduced TGFalpha levels that could explain the reported behavioral outcomes, biogenic amine and amino acid levels were determined in the brain regions associated with stress and memory. Interestingly, sex-specific alterations in neurochemical levels were detected, including elevated noradrenaline and reduced glutamate levels in striatum of Wa-1 males, increased noradrenaline and reduced serotonin metabolite levels in hippocampus of Wa-1 females, reduced serotonin metabolite levels in cortex and amygdala of Wa-1 females, and reduced noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and glycine levels in hypothalamus of Wa-1 females compared to their respective controls. Increased dopamine turnover in cortex and reduced dopamine and serotonin turnover in amygdala were observed in both male and female Wa-1 mice. The data indicate sex-specific alterations of specific neurochemicals as a result of reduced TGFalpha expression, which may underlie sex-dependent stress response and memory impairment in Wa-1 mice.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the habitat use and migration patterns of large sharks is important for assessing the effectiveness of large predator Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), vulnerability to fisheries and environmental influences, and management of shark–human interactions. Here we compare movement, reef-fidelity, and ocean migration for tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, across the Coral Sea, with an emphasis on New Caledonia. Thirty-three tiger sharks (1.54 to 3.9 m total length) were tagged with passive acoustic transmitters and their localised movements monitored on receiver arrays in New Caledonia, the Chesterfield and Lord Howe Islands in the Coral Sea, and the east coast of Queensland, Australia. Satellite tags were also used to determine habitat use and movements among habitats across the Coral Sea. Sub-adults and one male adult tiger shark displayed year-round residency in the Chesterfields with two females tagged in the Chesterfields and detected on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, after 591 and 842 days respectively. In coastal barrier reefs, tiger sharks were transient at acoustic arrays and each individual demonstrated a unique pattern of occurrence. From 2009 to 2013, fourteen sharks with satellite and acoustic tags undertook wide-ranging movements up to 1114 km across the Coral Sea with eight detected back on acoustic arrays up to 405 days after being tagged. Tiger sharks dove 1136 m and utilised three-dimensional activity spaces averaged at 2360 km3. The Chesterfield Islands appear to be important habitat for sub-adults and adult male tiger sharks. Management strategies need to consider the wide-ranging movements of large (sub-adult and adult) male and female tiger sharks at the individual level, whereas fidelity to specific coastal reefs may be consistent across groups of individuals. Coastal barrier reef MPAs, however, only afford brief protection for large tiger sharks, therefore determining the importance of other oceanic Coral Sea reefs should be a priority for future research.},

Fifteen grey seals from Sable Island, Canada were deployed with Vemco Mobile Transceivers and Satellite-GPS transmitters in October 2009, 13 of which were recaptured and units retrieved 79±2.3 days later during the following breeding season, December 2009–January 2010. An association between two individuals was defined as a cluster of acoustic detections where the time between detections was {\textless}30 min. Bathymetry, travel rate, and behavioural state (slow and fast movement) were determined for each GPS archival point (3.7±0.1 locations recorded per hour). Behavioural state was estimated using a hidden Markov model. All seals had been involved in associations with other instrumented seals while at sea, with a total of 1,872 acoustic detections recorded in 201 associations. The median number of detections per association was 3 (range: 1–151) and the median duration of an association was 0.17 h (range: {\textless}0.1–11.3 h). Linear mixed-effects models showed that associations occurred when seals were exhibiting slow movement (0.24±0.01 ms{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) on shallow (53.4±3.7 m) offshore banks where dominant prey is known to occur.

abstract = {Conservation efforts aimed at the whale shark, Rhincodon typus, remain limited by a lack of basic information on most aspects of its ecology, including global population structure, population sizes and movement patterns. Here we report on the movements of 47 Red Sea whale sharks fitted with three types of satellite transmitting tags from 2009-2011. Most of these sharks were tagged at a single aggregation site near Al-Lith, on the central coast of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea. Individuals encountered at this site were all juveniles based on size estimates ranging from 2.5-7 m total length with a sex ratio of approximately 1∶1. All other known aggregation sites for juvenile whale sharks are dominated by males. Results from tagging efforts showed that most individuals remained in the southern Red Sea and that some sharks returned to the same location in subsequent years. Diving data were recorded by 37 tags, revealing frequent deep dives to at least 500 m and as deep as 1360 m. The unique temperature-depth profiles of the Red Sea confirmed that several whale sharks moved out of the Red Sea while tagged. The wide-ranging horizontal movements of these individuals highlight the need for multinational, cooperative efforts to conserve R. typus populations in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.},

We investigate an idealized geolocation problem where the animal performs a random walk. We derive simple closed-form expressions for the steady-state variance and for the characteristic time scale of the filter, i.e. the smoothing horizon. This leads to temporal and spatial scales defining the limit of resolution and explains the difference between what can be obtained for fast-moving and slow-moving animals. Using frequency-domain methods, we consider the effect of adding additional sensors, and examine the substitution of the random walk model with anomalous diffusion, e.g. a L{\'{e}}vy flight. We also discuss time variations in the accuracy near start and end of the time series, and due to holes in the data stream which e.g. arise in the tidal method for geolocation when the animal is pelagic. Our results are particularly useful to the planning of a tagging study, because our estimates of accuracy can be computed using only three parameters: the swimming speed of the animal, the sample interval, and the variance on the measurement error.},

abstract = {In the three decades since its introduction, resource selection analysis (RSA) has become a widespread method for analyzing spatial patterns of animal relocations obtained from telemetry studies. Recently, mechanistic home range models have been proposed as an alternative framework for studying patterns of animal space-use. In contrast to RSA models, mechanistic home range models are derived from underlying mechanistic descriptions of individual movement behavior and yield spatially explicit predictions for patterns of animal space-use. In addition, their mechanistic underpinning means that, unlike RSA, mechanistic home range models can also be used to predict changes in space-use following perturbation. In this paper, we develop a formal reconciliation between these two methods of home range analysis, showing how differences in the habitat preferences of individuals give rise to spatially explicit patterns of space-use. The resulting unified framework combines the simplicity of resource selection analysis with the spatially explicit and predictive capabilities of mechanistic home range models.},

The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1° OI analyses.

abstract = {Animal movement has been the focus on much theoretical and empirical work in ecology over the last 25 years. By studying the causes and consequences of individual movement, ecologists have gained greater insight into the behavior of individuals and the spatial dynamics of populations at increasingly higher levels of organization. In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, first passage time, L{\'{e}}vy flights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability.},

abstract = {Three hatchery produced and reared (HPR) and five wild white sea bream (Diplodus sargus) were double tagged with Vemco V8SC-2L acoustic trans- mitters and Floy Tag T-bar anchor tags, and released on artificial reefs located near a natural reef off the southern coast of Portugal. Passive telemetry was used to moni- tor movements of the white sea bream over a nine week period from April to June 2007. Differences in behavior at release, habitat association (artificial vs. natural reef), and in daily movements were registered.Wild fish moved from one habitat to the other with increased preference for the artificial habitat during the day, whereas HPR fish showed no site fidelity or consistent daily movement pattern and left the release site soon after release. Comparison of Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) showed a higher area usage by wild fish. This experiment shows that these artifi- cial reefs are used on a daily basis by wild white sea bream but apparently are not optimal release locations for hatchery produced white sea bream.},

abstract = {The move to ecosystem-based management of marine fisheries and endangered species would be greatly facilitated by a quantitative method for identifying marine ecosystems that captures temporal dynamics at meso-scale (10s or 100s of kilometers) resolutions. Understanding the dynamics of ecosystem boundaries, which may differ according to the species of interest or the management objectives, is a fundamental challenge of ecosystem-based management. We present an adaptive ecosystem classification that begins to address these challenges. To demonstrate the approach, we quantitatively bounded distinct, biologically meaningful marine regions in the North Pacific Ocean based on physical oceanography. We identified the regions by applying image classification algorithms to a comprehensive description of the ocean's surface, derived from an oceanographic circulation model. Our resulting maps illustrate 15 distinct marine regions. The size and location of these regions related well to previously described water masses in the North Pacific. We investigated seasonal and long-term changes in the pattern of regions and their boundaries by dividing the oceanographic data into four seasons and two 10-year time periods, one on either side of the 1976-1977 North Pacific Ocean climate regime shift. We compared our results for each season across the regime shift and for sequential seasons within regimes using the Kappa Index of Agreement and the index of Average Mutual Information. Seasonal patterns were more similar between regimes than from one season to the next within a regime, while the magnitude of seasonal transitions appeared to differ before and after the regime shift. We assessed the biological relevance of the identified regions using seasonal maps derived from remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentrations ([chl-a]). We used Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to evaluate the correspondence between the [chl-a] maps and our post-regime shift regions. There was a significant difference in [chl-a] among the regions in all seasons. We found that the number of regions with distinct chlorophyll signatures, and the associations between different regions, varied by season. The overall pattern of association between the regions was suggestive of observed, broad-scale patterns in the seasonal development and distribution of primary production in the North Pacific. This demonstrated that regions with different biological properties can be delineated using only physical variables. The flexibility of our approach will enable researchers to visualize the geographic extents of regions with similar physical conditions, providing insight into ocean dynamics and changes in marine ecosystems. It will also provide resource managers with a powerful tool for broad application in ecosystem-based management and conservation of marine resources. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study of animal movement and behavior is being revolutionized by technology, such as satellite tags and harmonic radar, that allows us to track the movements of individual animals. However, our ability to analyze and model such data has lagged behind the sophisticated collection methods. We review problems with current methods and suggest a more powerful and flexible approach, state-space modeling, and we illustrate how these models can be posed in a meta-analytic framework so that information from individual trajectories may be combined optimally. State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broad- er-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation tech- niques, all under a single statistical framework.

We characterize the oceanographic and biological landscapes of the marine areas used by breeding Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes giganteus) at Patagonian colonies and explore inter-sexual and inter-colony differences. The at-sea movements of 16 adults (7 males and 9 females) were studied by means of satellite telemetry techniques during 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2004 breeding seasons. Southern Giant Petrels utilized an oceanographic scenario characterized by high productivity, warm sea surface temperature, and shallow waters. The biological landscape was characterized by a high availability of squid and carrion nearby colonies. Females spent more time in the shelf break and exploited deeper waters than males. In contrast, males spent more time in coastal areas and they showed a higher spatial overlap with areas of high squid density than females. Such a prosperous foraging scenario for both sexes may play a key role in the growth of the breeding population of Southern Giant Petrel Patagonian colonies.},

abstract = {Since the heterogeneity of oceanographic conditions drives abundance, distribution, and availability of prey, it is essential to understand how foraging predators interact with their dynamic environment at various spatial and temporal scales. We examined the spatio-temporal relationships between oceanographic features and abundance of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), the largest free-ranging predator in the Western Mediterranean Sea (WM), through two independent approaches. First, spatial modeling was used to estimate whale density, using waiting distance (the distance between detections) for fin whales along ferry routes across the WM, in relation to remotely sensed oceanographic parameters. At a large scale (basin and year), fin whales exhibited fidelity to the northern WM with a summer-aggregated and winter-dispersed pattern. At mesoscale (20-100. km), whales were found in colder, saltier (from an on-board system) and dynamic areas defined by steep altimetric and temperature gradients. Second, using an independent fin whale satellite tracking dataset, we showed that tracked whales were effectively preferentially located in favorable habitats, i.e. in areas of high predicted densities as identified by our previous model using oceanographic data contemporaneous to the tracking period. We suggest that the large-scale fidelity corresponds to temporally and spatially predictable habitat of whale favorite prey, the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), while mesoscale relationships are likely to identify areas of high prey concentration and availability. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Current lightbased geolocation techniques used to identify migration routes of highly mobile species have inherent limitations, depending on the type of tag technologies used. Recovered data storage tags provide detailed time series of light-levels suited for extensive post-processing, while pop-up satellite tags (PSATs) are bandwidth-limited and generally provide samples only at critical times of the day. An alternative approach is to detect a sunrise or sunset event and transmit only this information, thus freeing bandwidth for depth or temperature data. We show here that this geolocation technique retains the essential information to correct for known problems such as errors at the equinoxes. We describe the suitable model for such data, as well as the behavior of resulting location error and bias in simulated cases. Illustrations from PSAT tags at the ocean's surface and on a freely-swimming fish reveal a highly non-Gaussian error distribution. To solve for this, we present a more generalized estimation framework than linear Gaussian models, based on an extension of the Kalman filter. We apply iterative nonlinear Least squares to address non-Gaussian errors, non-linear dynamics and missing data. The proposed optimization method may include coastlines or bathymetric limits as hard constraints. Our results indicate that sunrise/sunset-based geolocation is a viable technique technique to surmount tag design or engineering limitations when tracking pelagic fish},

Inter-individual variation in migration propensity affects population dynamics and connectivity. The diversity of migratory behaviours of Atlantic cod (fork length {\textgreater}40 cm) in the northern Gulf of St Lawrence was studied using data-storage tags that record depth and temperature. Movement patterns of Atlantic cod equipped with data-storage tags were reconstructed using a geolocation model based on daily maximum depth and bottom temperature. Reconstructed migration routes revealed the previously undocumented coexistence of resident and migratory individuals in the population. Migratory cod overwintered in relatively deep (300–500 m) and warm (5°C) waters, while residents displayed a prolonged period of immobility in shallow ({\textless}100 m) and near-freezing (–1.5°C) coastal waters of western Newfoundland. In the spring, migratory cod displayed extensive diel vertical migration suggestive of spawning behaviour. The presence of alternative migratory behaviours should be considered in the spatiotemporal management of the collapsed population.},

Coordinate surfaces in this model adhere to isopycnals wherever this does not violate minimum layer thickness requirements; elsewhere, coordinate surfaces are geometrically constrained. The intent of this approach, some of whose features are reminiscent of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique, is to combine the best features of isopycnic-coordinate and fixed-grid circulation models within a single framework. The hybrid model is an offshoot of the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model whose solutions, obtained under identical geographic and forcing conditions, serve as reference. Century-scale simulations on a coarse-mesh near-global domain show considerable similarities in the modeled thermohaline-forced circulation. Certain architectural details, such as the choice of prognostic thermodynamic variables (??, S versus T, S) and the algorithm for moving coordinate surfaces toward their reference isopycnals, are found to only have a minor impact on the solution. Emphasis in this article is on the numerical resiliency of the hybrid coordinate approach. Exploitation of the model's flexible coordinate layout in areas of ocean physics where pure isopycnic coordinate models only have limited options, such as mixed-layer turbulence parameterization, will be the subject of forthcoming articles. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {* Analyses of animal resource selection functions (RSF) using data collected from relocations of individuals via remote telemetry devices have become commonplace. Increasing technological advances, however, have produced statistical challenges in analysing such highly autocorrelated data. Weighted distribution methods have been proposed for analysing RSFs with telemetry data. However, they can be computationally challenging due to an intractable normalizing constant and cannot be aggregated (i.e. collapsed) over time to make space-only inference. * In this study, we take a conceptually different approach to modelling animal telemetry data for making RSF inference. We consider the telemetry data to be a realization of a space–time point process. Under the point process paradigm, the times of the relocations are also considered to be random rather than fixed. * We show the point process models we propose are a generalization of the weighted distribution telemetry models. By generalizing the weighted model, we can access several numerical techniques for evaluating point process likelihoods that make use of common statistical software. Thus, the analysis methods can be readily implemented by animal ecologists. * In addition to ease of computation, the point process models can be aggregated over time by marginalizing over the temporal component of the model. This allows a full range of models to be constructed for RSF analysis at the individual movement level up to the study area level. * To demonstrate the analysis of telemetry data with the point process approach, we analysed a data set of telemetry locations from northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska. Both a space–time and an aggregated space-only model were fitted. At the individual level, the space–time analysis showed little selection relative to the habitat covariates. However, at the study area level, the space-only model showed strong selection relative to the covariates.},

abstract = {Recent progress in positioning technology facilitates the collection of massive amounts of sequential spatial data on animals. This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs. Keywords},

abstract = {The lack of comprehensive sighting data sets precludes the application of standard habitat suitability modeling approaches to predict distributions of the majority of marine mammal species on very large scales. As an alternative, we developed an ecological niche model to map global distributions of 115 cetacean and pinniped species living in the marine environment using more readily available expert knowledge about habitat usage. We started by assigning each species to broad-scale niche categories with respect to depth, sea-surface temperature, and ice edge association based on synopses of published information. Within a global information system framework and a global grid of 0.5° latitude/longitude cell dimensions, we then generated an index of the relative environmental suitability (RES) of each cell for a given species by relating known habitat usage to local environmental conditions. RES predictions closely matched published maximum ranges for most species, thus representing useful, more objective alternatives to existing sketched distributional outlines. In addition, raster-based predictions provided detailed information about heterogeneous patterns of potentially suitable habitat for species throughout their range. We tested RES model outputs for 11 species (northern fur seal, harbor porpoise, sperm whale, killer whale, hourglass dolphin, fin whale, humpback whale, blue whale, Antarctic minke, and dwarf minke whales) from a broad taxonomic and geographic range, using data from dedicated surveys. Observed encounter rates and species-specific predicted environmental suitability were significantly and positively correlated for all but 1 species. In comparison, encounter rates were correlated with {\textless}1{\%} of 1000 simulated random data sets for all but 2 species. Mapping of large-scale marine mammal distributions using this environmental envelope model is helpful for evaluating current assumptions and knowledge about species' occurrences, especially for data-poor species. Moreover, RES modeling can help to focus research efforts on smaller geographic scales and usefully supplement other, statistical, habitat suitability models.},

abstract = {Detailed observation of the movement of individual animals offers the potential to understand spatial population processes as the ultimate consequence of individual behaviour, physiological constraints and fine-scale environmental influences. However, movement data from individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe observation error. Linking such complex data to dynamical models of movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

abstract = {Habitat selection is a fundamental aspect of animal ecology, the understanding of which is critical to management and conservation. Global positioning system data from animals allow fine-scale assessments of habitat selection and typically are analyzed in a use– availability framework, whereby animal locations are contrasted with random locations (the availability sample). Although most use–availability methods are in fact spatial point process models, they often are fit using logistic regression. This framework offers numerous methodological challenges, for which the literature provides little guidance. Specifically, the size and spatial extent of the availability sample influences coefficient estimates potentially causing interpretational bias. We examined the influence of availability on statistical inference through simulations and analysis of serially correlated mule deer GPS data. Bias in estimates arose from incorrectly assessing and sampling the spatial extent of availability. Spatial autocorrelation in covariates, which is common for landscape characteristics, exacerbated the error in availability sampling leading to increased bias. These results have strong implications for habitat selection analyses using GPS data, which are increasingly prevalent in the literature. We recommend that researchers assess the sensitivity of their results to their availability sample and, where bias is likely, take care with interpretations and use cross validation to assess robustness},

Marine ecosystems vary temporally on diel to decadal scales and spatially on scales from several meters to 1000s of kilometers. Many cetacean species are wideranging and respond to this variability by changes in distribution patterns. Cetacean–habitat models have already been used to incorporate this variability into management applications, including improvement of abundance estimates, development of marine protected areas, and understanding cetacean–fisheries interactions. We present a review of the development of cetacean–habitat models, organized according to the primary steps involved in the modeling process. Topics covered include purposes for which cetacean–habitat models are developed, scale issues in marine ecosystems, cetacean and habitat data collection, descriptive and statistical modeling techniques, model selection, and model evaluation. To date, descriptive statistical techniques have been used to explore cetacean–habitat relationships for selected species in specific areas; the numbers of species and geographic areas examined using computationally intensive statistic modeling techniques are considerably less, and the development of models to test specific hypotheses about the ecological processes determining cetacean distributions has just begun. Future directions in cetacean–habitat modeling span a wide range of possibilities, from development of basic modeling techniques to addressing important ecological questions.},

abstract = {Tractable conservation measures for long-lived species require the intersection between protection of biologically relevant life history stages and a socioeconomically feasible setting. To protect breeding adults, we require knowledge of animal movements, how movement relates to political boundaries, and our confidence in spatial analyses of movement. We used satellite tracking and a switching state-space model to determine the internesting movements of olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) (n = 18) in Central Africa during two breeding seasons (2007-08, 2008-09). These movements were analyzed in relation to current park boundaries and a proposed transboundary park between Gabon and the Republic of Congo, both created to reduce unintentional bycatch of sea turtles in marine fisheries. We additionally determined confidence intervals surrounding home range calculations. Turtles remained largely within a 30 km radius from the original nesting site before departing for distant foraging grounds. Only 44.6 percent of high-density areas were found within the current park but the proposed transboundary park would incorporate 97.6 percent of high-density areas. Though tagged individuals originated in Gabon, turtles were found in Congolese waters during greater than half of the internesting period (53.7 percent), highlighting the need for international cooperation and offering scientific support for a proposed transboundary park. This is the first comprehensive study on the internesting movements of solitary nesting olive ridley sea turtles, and it suggests the opportunity for tractable conservation measures for female nesting olive ridleys at this and other solitary nesting sites around the world. We draw from our results a framework for cost-effective protection of long-lived species using satellite telemetry as a primary tool.},

abstract = {Abstract Striped marlin (Kajikia audax) are highly valuable in commercial and recreational fisheries, and recently determined to be overfished in the Western and Central North Pacific Ocean, but direct field observations of their vertical habitats are lacking. To characterize their spatial and oceanographic associations across multiple regions in the Pacific (Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, Southern California, Baja California, Costa Rica, Panama, and Ecuador), we analyzed behavioral data returned by 159 pop-up satellite archival tags (median, maximum deployment: 61; 259 days). Striped marlin demonstrated pronounced use of the mixed layer, with fish spending at least 54{\%} of their time between 0 and 10 m across all regions. Individuals remained near the surface in nighttime and were located near the bottom of the mixed layer during daytime. Although striped marlin shared a thermal niche {\textgreater}20 °C and remained within ∼8 °C of sea surface temperature (SST), even when 15–31 °C SSTs were experienced, the deepest depth (532 m) and coldest temperature (8.6 °C) recorded to date indicated broader habitat associations. Vertical activity below the mixed layer comprised a lesser portion (5–45{\%}) of their time at depth but suggests that key ecological functions occur there. We examined the effects of spatiotemporal and environmental factors on percent time spent at ≥60 m and maximum depth through the use of generalized additive mixed models. Location, SST, mixed layer depth, temperature at 100 m and dissolved oxygen at 100 m and 300 m were significant predictors of vertical activity. Striped marlin exploited cold ({\textless}15 °C) or low oxygen ({\textless}3.5 ml L−1) environments for short durations (10–40 min), presumably for foraging and predator avoidance. Understanding vertical habitat characteristics of striped marlin is necessary for evaluating their vulnerability to gear, for identification of realistic bycatch reduction measures, and for providing spatially explicit information in stock assessments.},

The error-correction is based on a hidden Markov model and uses the Viterbi algorithm to calculate the most probable error-free target binary mask from a target binary mask containing errors. The results demonstrate that it is possible to correct errors in the target binary mask and reduce the noise energy. However, speech energy is also reduced by the error-correction, but the impact on speech intelligibility and speech quality are not established or evaluated in the present study.},

We employ error propagation analysis to the fundamental equation relating latitude to solar elevation and time of day. Large latitude errors are caused by mathematical amplification of small errors in relating solar irradiance to solar elevation. Furthermore, the sign of these errors is such that the estimated latitude is badly biased. This analysis leads directly to a method of removing systematic error (bias) from latitude estimates in state-space track reconstruction models. Preliminary implementation of this method effectively removes all bias from latitude estimated from solar irradiance recorded by archival tags deployed both on moorings and on freely swimming tuna},

abstract = {Recent Studies have applied state-space models to satellite telemetry data in order to remove noise from raw location estimates and infer the true tracks of animals. However, while the resulting tracks May appear plausible, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the estimated positions, especially for position estimates interpolated to times between satellite locations. In this study, we use data from two gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) carrying, tags that transmitted Fastloc GPS positions via Argos satellites. This combination of Service Argos data and highly accurate GPS data allowed examination of the accuracy of state-space position estimates and their uncertainty derived from satellite telemetry data After applying a speed filter to remove aberrant satellite telemetry locations. we fit a continuous-time Kalman filter to estimate the parameters of I random walk, used Kalman smoothing to infer positions at the times of the GPS Measurements. and then compared the filtered telemetry estimates with the actual GPS Measurements. We investigated the effect of varying maximum speed thresholds in the speed-filtering algorithm oil the root mean-square error (RMSE) estimates and used minimum RMSE as a criterion to guide the final choice of speed threshold. The optimal speed thresholds differed between the two animals (1.1 m/s and 2.5 m/s) and retained 50{\%} and 65{\%} of the data for each seal. However, using a speed filter of 1.1 m/s resulted in very similar RMSE for both animals. For the two seals. the RMSE of the Kalman-filtered estimates of location were 5.9 and 12.76 km, respectively, and 75{\%} of the modeled positions had errors less than 6.25 km and 11.7 km for each seal. Confidence interval coverage was close to correct at typical levels (80-95{\%}), although it tended to be overly generous at smaller sizes. The reliability Of uncertainty estimates was also affected by the chosen sliced threshold. The combination of sliced and Kalman filtering allows for effective calculation of location and also indicates the limits of accuracy when correcting service Argos locations and linking satellite telemetry data to spatial covariate and habitat data.},

abstract = {Geolocation data were recovered from archival tags applied to bigeye tuna near Hawaii. A state-space Kalman filter statistical model was used to estimate geolocation errors, movement parameters, and most probable tracks from the recovered data. Standard deviation estimates ranged from 0.5degrees to 4.4degrees latitude and from 0.2degrees to 1.6degrees longitude. Bias estimates ranged from -1.9degrees to 4.1degrees latitude and from -0.5degrees to 3.0degrees longitude. Estimates of directed movement were close to zero for most fish reaching a maximum magnitude of 5.3 nm day(-1) for the one fish that moved away from its release site. Diffusivity estimates were also low, ranging from near zero to 1000 nm(2) day(-1) . Low values of the estimated movement parameters are consistent with the restricted scale of the observed movement and the apparent fidelity of bigeye to geographical points of attraction. Inclusion of a time-dependent model of the variance in geolocation estimates reduced the variability of latitude estimates. The state-space Kalman filter model appears to provide realistic estimates of in situ geolocation errors and movement parameters, provides a means to avoid indeterminate latitude estimates during equinoxes, and is a potential bridge between analyses of individual and population movements.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary Animal space use and movements are best understood through direct observation. This chapter describes a variety of techniques used to analyze animal space use, including home range estimation, analysis of site fidelity, and animal interactions. It also provides limitations of using many traditional techniques. The chapter provides a discussion of modeling animal movements using a combination of advanced descriptive and visualization approaches, general movement models, and biological models. The importance of sample size and autocorrelation of data in estimating home ranges and animal movements cannot be overemphasized. When considering tradeoffs between sample size and independence, obtaining an adequate sample size is more important than independence between data points. Any analysis of radiotelemetry data must consider the full range of biological and environmental factors that may impact the results. Home range estimation and animal movement analyses must answer difficult questions regarding the internal anatomy of home range boundaries and movement pathways through the judicious use of biological and environmental information. Also, radiotelemetry studies should go beyond simple, general descriptions and use a model-driven approach to examine the key factors determining why and how an animal uses space.},

abstract = {Colonial seabirds are relatively easy to observe, count, measure and manipulate, and consequently have long been used as models for testing ecological hypotheses. A combination of animal tracking and satellite imagery has the potential to greatly inform such efforts, by allowing seabird-environment interactions to be observed remotely. We review how this can be achieved by applying innovative statistical techniques to quantify habitat use and preferences. Seabird movements are now observable at scales of meters using GPS loggers, and up to several years using light-based geolocation, while satellite remote sensing systems, at resolutions of km, are capable of characterizing the millions of km(2) of habitat that are accessible to seabirds. Physical forcing and biological processes result in a hierarchical, patchy distribution of prey. Hence, analyses of seabird movements should be conducted at appropriate scales. Variation in habitat accessibility should also be considered: this declines with distance from the colony during the breeding season, when seabirds are central place foragers, and may be limited in the nonbreeding period by migration corridors that are defined by wind patterns. Intraspecific competition can further modify spatial usage, leading to spatial segregation of birds foraging from different colonies. We recommend that spatial usage be modeled as a function of habitat preference, accessibility and, potentially, competition. At the population level, this is currently best achieved using an empirical approach (e.g. using mixed-effects generalized additive models), At the individual level, more mechanistic models (e.g. state-space models) are more appropriate and have the advantage of modeling location errors explicitly.},

abstract = {Many species undertake long-distance annual migrations between foraging and reproductive areas. Such migrants depend on the efficient packaging, storage and utilization of energy to succeed. A diverse assemblage of organisms accomplishes this through the use of lipid reserves; yet, it remains unclear whether the migrations of elasmobranchs, which include the largest gill breathers on Earth, depend on such a mechanism. We examine depth records from pop-up satellite archival tags to discern changes in buoyancy as a proxy for energy storage in Eastern Pacific white sharks, and assess whether lipid depletion fuels long-distance (approx. 4000 km) migrations. We develop new algorithms to assess body condition, buoyancy and drift rate during drift dives and validate the techniques using a captive white shark. In the wild, we document a consistent increase in drift rate over the course of all migrations, indicating a decrease in buoyancy caused by the depletion of lipid reserves. These results comprise, to our knowledge, the first assessment of energy storage and budgeting in migrating sharks. The methods provide a basis for further insights into using electronic tags to reveal the energetic strategies of a wide range of elasmobranchs.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Animal tracking is a growing field in ecology and previous work has shown that simple speed filtering of tracking data is not sufficient and that improvement of tracking location estimates are possible. To date, this has required methods that are complicated and often time-consuming (state-space models), resulting in limited application of this technique and the potential for analysis errors due to poor understanding of the fundamental framework behind the approach. We describe and test an alternative and intuitive approach consisting of bootstrapping random walks biased by forward particles. The model uses recorded data accuracy estimates, and can assimilate other sources of data such as sea-surface temperature, bathymetry and/or physical boundaries. We tested our model using ARGOS and geolocation tracks of elephant seals that also carried GPS tags in addition to PTTs, enabling true validation. Among pinnipeds, elephant seals are extreme divers that spend little time at the surface, which considerably impact the quality of both ARGOS and light-based geolocation tracks. Despite such low overall quality tracks, our model provided location estimates within 4.0, 5.5 and 12.0 km of true location 50{\%} of the time, and within 9, 10.5 and 20.0 km 90{\%} of the time, for above, equal or below average elephant seal ARGOS track qualities, respectively. With geolocation data, 50{\%} of errors were less than 104.8 km ({\textless}0.94°), and 90{\%} were less than 199.8 km ({\textless}1.80°). Larger errors were due to lack of sea-surface temperature gradients. In addition we show that our model is flexible enough to solve the obstacle avoidance problem by assimilating high resolution coastline data. This reduced the number of invalid on-land location by almost an order of magnitude. The method is intuitive, flexible and efficient, promising extensive utilization in future research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {    1     Temporal variability in habitat suitability has important conservation and ecological implications. In grasslands, changes in resource availability can occur at broad spatial scales and enlarge area requirements of ungulate populations, which increases their vulnerability to habitat loss and fragmentation. Understanding and predicting these dynamics, although critical, has received little attention so far.     2     We investigated habitat dynamics for Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa Pallas) in the eastern steppes of Mongolia. We quantified the distribution of gazelles at four different time periods and tracked primary productivity using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from satellite imagery.     3     A second-order logistic model showed that NDVI was an efficient predictor of gazelle presence. We tested the predictive power of the model with independent data from a gazelle telemetry study: 85{\%} of all relocations were found within the predicted area.     4     Gazelles preferred an intermediate range of vegetation productivity, presumably facing quality quantity trade-offs where areas with low NDVI are limited by low ingestion rates, and areas with high NDVI are limited by the low digestibility of mature forage.     5     Spatiotemporal variation of gazelle habitat areas was high. Only 15{\%} of the study area was consistently gazelle habitat throughout all survey periods, indicating that gazelles need to range over vast areas in search of food. Only 1{\%} of the gazelle habitats were consistently located inside protected areas.     6     Synthesis and applications. Habitat variability in grasslands often leads to area requirements of ungulates that prevent effective conservation within single protected areas. They require landscape-level management plans, but dynamic habitat predictions to inform such plans are difficult to implement and are often unavailable. We showed that satellite estimates of vegetation productivity can be used successfully to generate dynamic habitat models in landscapes with highly variable resources, and demonstrated that intermediate NDVI values were critical to predict occurrence of Mongolian gazelles.},

abstract = {A weekly 1° spatial resolution optimum interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis has been produced at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) using both in situ and satellite data from November 1981 to the present. The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly −0.03°C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1°C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales with monthly rms differences exceeding 0.5°C in some regions. These regions are primarily the mid- and high-latitude Southern Oceans and the Arctic where data are sparse, as well as high-gradient areas such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio where the gradients cannot be properly resolved on a 1° grid. In addition, globally averaged differences of roughly 0.05°C occur among the products on decadal scales. These differences primarily arise from the same regions where the rms differences are large. However, smaller unexplained differences also occur in other regions of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere where in situ data should be adequate.},

abstract = {Diving ontogeny studies enable the examination of both the evolution of diving strategies and the physiological constraints and environmental factors determining foraging behaviour. Northern fur seal (NFS) Callorhinus ursinus pups that undertake far-ranging migrations in their first year are an ideal species for examining such factors. The diving behaviour of 64 NFS pups from 4 North American breeding sites was studied using satellite-dive recorders deployed on pups prior to weaning. Summarised diving activity (6 h histograms of dive depth and duration) was recorded during the pups' first 8 mo at sea and transmitted via satellite. During the first month at sea, pups adopted the nocturnal diving patterns characteristic of adults, with average maximum nightly and crepuscular dive depths and durations exceeding daytime values by a factor of from 4 to 4.5. Diving capacity in terms of maximum depths (112 m) and durations (285 s) attained also increased linearly with age until {\~{}}8 to 10 mo of age. Overlaid on diving capability development was the significant influence of environmental cues, such as lunar phase, on migratory diving behaviour. During full moons, pups dived deeper and for longer periods than during other lunar phases, as pups likely mimicked the behaviour of their vertically migrating prey. These findings indicate that prey accessibility, particularly for younger pups with reduced diving capacity, may prove more challenging during higher lunar illumination periods. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

Data from nine tags (range: 1–292 days; mean: 89 days) revealed (i) pronounced north–south movements in pelagic waters between areas including Georges Bank, Mid- and South Atlantic Bight, Caribbean Sea, and Brazilian shelf, (ii) a lack of east–west exchange, and (iii) a high-use area in the Hatteras Plain, centered southwest of Bermuda. Bigeye tuna occupied water masses of 2.7–28.2 °C and depths of 0–1280 m, with deeper depths in the daytime (daily mean ± standard deviation: 196 ± 92 m) than at nighttime (45 ± 29 m). Even though bigeye tuna are assumed to forage on the deep scattered layer during the day, generalized additive mixed models did not identify the deep scattered layer as an important predictor of daytime swimming depth. Model results highlight the importance of geographic location in influencing habitat utilization, and thus suggest the need for fisheries-independent monitoring in high-catch areas, such as the central and equatorial Atlantic.},

abstract = {    * Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized.   * Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets.   * Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation.   * ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed.   * We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.  },

abstract = {Aim To demonstrate how the interrelations of individual movements form large- scale population-level movement patterns and how these patterns are associated with the underlying landscape dynamics by comparing ungulate movements across species. Locations Arctic tundra in Alaska and Canada, temperate forests in Massachu- setts, Patagonian Steppes in Argentina, Eastern Steppes in Mongolia. Methods We used relocation data from four ungulate species (barren-ground caribou, Mongolian gazelle, guanaco and moose) to examine individual move- ments and the interrelation of movements among individuals. We applied and developed a suite of spatial metrics that measure variation in movement among individuals as population dispersion,movement coordination and realized mobil- ity. Taken together, these metrics allowed us to quantify and distinguish among different large-scale population-level movement patterns such as migration, range residency and nomadism.We then related the population-levelmovement patterns to the underlying landscape vegetation dynamics via long-term remote sensing measurements of the temporal variability, spatial variability and unpredictability of vegetation productivity. Results Moose, which remained in sedentary home ranges, and guanacos, which were partially migratory, exhibited relatively short annual movements associated with landscapes having very little broad-scale variability in vegetation.Caribou and gazelle performed extreme long-distance movements that were associated with broad-scale variability in vegetation productivity during the peak of the growing season. Caribou exhibited regular seasonal migration in which individuals were clustered for most of the year and exhibited coordinated movements. In contrast, gazelle were nomadic, as individuals were independently distributed andmoved in an uncoordinated manner that relates to the comparatively unpredictable (yet broad-scale) vegetation dynamics of their landscape. Main conclusions We show how broad-scale landscape unpredictability may lead to nomadism, an understudied type of long-distancemovement. In contrast to classical migration where landscapes may vary at broad scales but in a predictable manner, long-distance movements of nomadic individuals are uncoordinated and independent from other such individuals. Landscapes with little broad-scale vari- ability in vegetation productivity feature smaller-scale movements and allow for range residency. Nomadism requires distinct integrative conservation strategies that facilitate long-distance movements across the entire landscape and are not limited to certain migration corridors.},

abstract = {The reliable estimation of animal location, and its associated error is fundamental to animal ecology. There are many existing techniques for handling location error, but these are often ad hoc or are used in isolation from each other. In this study we present a Bayesian framework for determining location that uses all the data available, is flexible to all tagging techniques, and provides location estimates with built-in measures of uncertainty. Bayesian methods allow the contributions of multiple data sources to be decomposed into manageable components. We illustrate with two examples for two different location methods: satellite tracking and light level geo-location. We show that many of the problems with uncertainty involved are reduced and quantified by our approach. This approach can use any available information, such as existing knowledge of the animal's potential range, light levels or direct location estimates, auxiliary data, and movement models. The approach provides a substantial contribution to the handling uncertainty in archival tag and satellite tracking data using readily available tools.},

These developments are revolutionizing the scope and scale of questions that can be asked about the causes and consequences of movement and are redefining how we view and manage individuals, populations, and entire ecosystems.

abstract = {1.  Linking the movement and behaviour of animals to their environment is a central problem in ecology. Through the use of electronic tagging and tracking (ETT), collection of in situ data from free-roaming animals is now commonplace, yet statistical approaches enabling direct relation of movement observations to environmental conditions are still in development.  2.  In this study, we examine the hidden Markov model (HMM) for behavioural analysis of tracking data. HMMs allow for prediction of latent behavioural states while directly accounting for the serial dependence prevalent in ETT data. Updating the probability of behavioural switches with tag or remote-sensing data provides a statistical method that links environmental data to behaviour in a direct and integrated manner.  3.  It is important to assess the reliability of state categorization over the range of time-series lengths typically collected from field instruments and when movement behaviours are similar between movement states. Simulation with varying lengths of times series data and contrast between average movements within each state was used to test the HMMs ability to estimate movement parameters.  4.  To demonstrate the methods in a realistic setting, the HMMs were used to categorize resident and migratory phases and the relationship between movement behaviour and ocean temperature using electronic tagging data from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). Diagnostic tools to evaluate the suitability of different models and inferential methods for investigating differences in behaviour between individuals are also demonstrated.},

abstract = {The world's second largest fish, the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), is broadly distributed in boreal to warm temperate latitudes of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans from shallow coastal waters to the open ocean. Previous satellite archival tagging in the North Atlantic has shown that basking sharks move seasonally, are often associated with productive frontal zones, and may make occasional dives to mesopelagic depths. However, basking sharks are thought to be restricted to temperate latitudes, and the extent to which they exploit deeper-water habitat remains enigmatic. Via satellite archival tags and a novel geolocation technique, we demonstrate here that basking sharks are seasonal migrants to mesopelagic tropical waters. Tagged sharks moved from temperate feeding areas off the coast of southern New England to the Bahamas, the Caribbean Sea, and onward to the coast of South America and into the Southern Hemisphere. When in these areas, basking sharks descended to mesopelagic depths and in some cases remained there for weeks to months at a time. Our results demonstrate that tropical waters are not a barrier to migratory connectivity for basking shark populations and highlight the need for global conservation efforts throughout the species range.},
